Homework 13

At the beginning of the class, we worked on a click game involving gemstones and scoring a certain amount in order to win. Now, we're importing and exporting different components to repeat the click game. However, I added a twist to the click game and took the characters from Fire Emblem Heroes (the phone gatcha game.) 

The game starts out shuffling the characters. The goal of the game is to get the highest score. Each character can only be clicked once before it resets. Should you click on the same character twice, the game ends and restarts the score. The game will then maintain the highest score. 

There are only two folders. The public folder is a placeholder for the app. Most of the data is in the src folder that can only be viewed via npm start. Most of the data is outside of the component folder. The cards has the pictures you need for the game while the App.js is where most of the code is. The components folder is split into the card, header and wrapper section. The CSS is in each folder with an index that exports the code to the front. 

In order for the program to work, follow these instructions.

1. Have Visual Studio Code on your computer
2. Git clone 
3. Put the src folder into the my-app of your computer.
4. Use NPM start to turn on the program.
