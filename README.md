Homework 13

At the beginning of the class, we worked on a click game involving gemstones and scoring a certain amount in order to win. Now, we're importing and exporting different components to repeat the click game. However, I added a twist to the click game and took the characters from Fire Emblem Heroes (the phone gatcha game.) 

The game starts out shuffling the characters.
